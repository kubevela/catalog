# ChartMuseum

*ChartMuseum* is an open-source **[Helm Chart Repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/)** server written in Go (Golang), with support for cloud storage backends, including [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/), [Alibaba Cloud OSS Storage](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/oss), [Openstack Object Storage](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/object-store/), [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage](https://cloud.oracle.com/storage), [Baidu Cloud BOS Storage](https://cloud.baidu.com/product/bos.html), [Tencent Cloud Object Storage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cos), [Netease Cloud NOS Storage](https://www.163yun.com/product/nos), [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/), [Minio](https://min.io/), and [etcd](https://etcd.io/).

In addition to using ChartMuseum as you regular Helm Chart registry, you can also store your custom KubeVela addons in it.

## Quick Start

There are instructions on official KubeVela documentation website: 

> Documentation link will be here once the doc PR is merged

## Usages
### Authentication

> Warning: to prevent anonymous uploads, do any of the following: 
> - set `disableAPI` to `true`
> - enable authentication

By default this addon does not have any authentication configured and allows anyone to fetch or upload charts (unless the API is disabled with `disableAPI`).

To enable Basic Auth to protect APIs, configure `basicAuth` parameters:

```json5
// +usage=Basic auth settings
basicAuth: {
	// +usage=Username for basic http authentication
	username: "user"
	// +usage=Password for basic http authentication
	password: "pswd"
}
```

### Using with local filesystem storage

By default ChartMuseum uses local filesystem storage. But on pod recreation it will lose all charts, to prevent that, enable persistent storage. This will store your data to a automatically created PVC.

```json5
persistence: {
	enabled: true
}
```

> WARNING: even if you enabled persistent storage, when you disable the addon, data will still be deleted. Because the PVC will be deleted as well. 

You should consider using a existing PVC by specifying `pvcName`.

```json5
persistence: {
	enabled: true
	pvcName: "mypvc"
}
```

### Using with Alibaba Cloud OSS Storage

Make sure your environment is properly setup to access `my-oss-bucket`.

To do so, you must set the following parameters:
- `accessKeyID`
- `accessKeySecret`

```json5
// +usage=Storage backend, can be one of: local(default), alibaba, amazon, google, microsoft
storge: "alibaba"
// +usage=Alibaba Cloud storage backend settings
alibaba: {
	// +usage=OSS bucket to store charts for alibaba storage backend, e.g. my-oss-bucket
	bucket: "my-oss-bucket"
	// +usage=OSS endpoint to store charts for alibaba storage backend, e.g. oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com
	endpoint: "oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com"
	// +usage=Alibaba OSS access key id
	accessKeyID: "accessKeyID"
	// +usage=Alibaba OSS access key secret
	accessKeySecret: "accessKeySecret"
}
```

### Using with Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

Make sure your environment is properly setup to access `mycontainer`.

To do so, you must set the following parameters:
- `account`
- `accessKey`

Specify `custom.yaml` with such values

```json5
// +usage=Storage backend, can be one of: local(default), alibaba, amazon, google, microsoft
storage: "microsoft"
// +usage=Microsoft Azure storage backend settings
microsoft: {
	// +usage=Container to store charts for microsoft storage backend
	container: "mycontainer"
	// +usage=Azure storage account
	account: "account"
	// +usage=Azure storage account access key
	accessKey: "key"
}
```

### Using with Google Cloud Storage and a Google Service Account

```json5
// +usage=Storage backend, can be one of: local(default), alibaba, amazon, google, microsoft
storage: "google"
// +usage=GCP storage backend settings
google: {
	// +usage=GCS bucket to store charts for google storage backend, e.g. my-gcs-bucket
	bucket: "my-gcs-bucket"
	// +usage=GCP service account json string
	googleCredentialsJSON: "jsonstring"
}
```

### Using with Amazon S3
Make sure your environment is properly setup to access `my-s3-bucket`

You need at least the following permissions inside your IAM Policy
```yaml
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowListObjects",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-bucket"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowObjectsCRUD",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### permissions grant with access keys

Grant permissions to `special user` and use it's access keys for auth on aws

```json5
// +usage=Storage backend, can be one of: local(default), alibaba, amazon, google, microsoft
storage: "amazon"
// +usage=AWS storage backend settings
amazon: {
	// +usage=S3 bucket to store charts for amazon storage backend, e.g. my-s3-bucket
	bucket: "my-s3-bucket"
	// +usage=Region of s3 bucket to store charts, e.g. us-east-1
	region: "us-east-1"
	// +usage=AWS access key id
	accessKeyID: "keyid"
	// +usage=AWS access key secret
	accessKeySecret: "secret"
}
```
