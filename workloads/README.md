Currently we have OAM workloads as below:

## Core Workloads

- [ContainerizedWorkload](https://github.com/crossplane/addon-oam-kubernetes-local) is the core workload implementation of OAM.

## Experimental Workloads

- [StatefulSet Workload](statefulset/README.md) gives an example how to use the K8s native StatefulSet as OAM workload.
